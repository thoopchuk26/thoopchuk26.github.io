Not much happened this month, I finished out all my graduate college submissions which took up most of the first
half of this already short month. In terms of programming, almost nothing got done this month frankly.

I worked on more of the vulkan guide from vkguide.com and got a decent amount of the ways through it but I still
didn't have a great idea of how tf vulkan works. It's a long road ahead of me to try and figure out wtf I'm 
doing with my life, and even longer to make something out of it. 

Current plans are to wait on graduate school responses and move to a major city to finally find some dev work. Personal projects are cool but they hardly pay the bills and I'm finding it ever harder to keep motivation.
