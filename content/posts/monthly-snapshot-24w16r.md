My god March was depressing idk how tf I did anything that month. Anyways April has gone much better in terms of vibes,
as well as actually getting work done (surprising I know). 

I got back on the Leetcode grind learning algorithms and stuff and it's been pretty fun ngl. Finally learned that it makes no fuckin sense to try and come up with algorithms on my own and instead you should just read solutions posted there but slowly work through it so you understand the intent and concept behind all of it. 

In terms of my vulkan engine, It's actually been progressing along really well! Finally finished up all the content on vkguide
and read back through sections whenever I needed a refresher on how stuff works. Currently working on getting instanced rendering to work in order to do some barebones Minecraft-esque terrain generation as a first test of my abilites. Definitely
struggling with memory allocation in the environment though however, VMA helps a lot but it's pretty hard to debug in any meaningful way.

Most importantly however I received responses from all but one of my grad school submissions (they rejected me), but this
means I can finally work towards moving to another state, as the state I planned on moving to is the same one that hasn't
sent me a return yet, so worst case they accept me and I already live there. This year is moving a long kinda slowly for me
ngl, but I think I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and living the life I want to live, not the
one I'm forced to.
