It's March babey (it is no longer march). Anyways not too much changed in my life this month. Continued trudging along in my
effort to learn Vulkan, and graphics programming in general. Progressing through vkguide and building a barebones engine
that I can start making stuff with. Still a little to early to call it usable, but it's certainly an interesting project
to work on when it's not breaking for no reason (the reason is that I don't know what I'm doing).

No graduate school responses yet. Likely to come in next month or in May at the latest hopefully. Not particularly hopeful,
but I was proud of my GRE score so I can at least know that it wasn't that. Generally I just need to work on stuff and get
more experience. Living where I do doesn't allow for many opportunities in-person, and the job market is flooded with
higher quality employees than I for remote work. So I don't have much reason to even apply to most places honestly.

Hopefully I can get grad school responses soon so I can move anywhere else and actually start my professional career. Either that or kill myself, so we'll see which one happens first.
