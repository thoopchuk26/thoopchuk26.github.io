Most of my time in January was dominated by studying for taking the GRE test and applying to various grad schools. 
While I don't exactly know how much I deserve to be accepted to grad schools I figured I would apply anyways as a 
way to kickstart my career and try to actually work on the things I want to with more help than just the internet (fat chance).

Unrelated but wtf is going on with the internet, this thing is unnavigable, full of misinformation, and there's just barely
any content regarding stuff like graphics rendering and proper c++ practices that aren't held in 25lb books. Can't believe 
that one of the most well-used languages that is nearly half a century old is the language with the least amount of proper
on-boarding for some god-forsaken reason. God I hope Carbon fixes these problems cause trying to use rust seems like a hassle for graphics programming when C++ is obviously the industry standard. 

All this to say that I didn't do much in January related to programming. It'll take awhile before I know what I should be doing
next given the admissions time, but for now I will sit in my room toiling away on programs that will likely never do anything of meaningful importance. Such is the life of a programmer who is so hopelessly lost in the tech he works on. Oh well.
