Hey my name is Trey, I'm a software developer that primarily works in C++. I graduated from Hendrix College in 2023 and I currently spend my time doing coding problems and working on projects related to video games in one way or another.

My current specification is graphics programming and simulations in the pursuit of creating or working on game engines in the future. In general I enjoy creating and learning about all the back end that goes into video game development and how it tends to test a larger breadth of technical knowledge than most fields.

You can take a look at my projects tab to learn all about the projects I like to share, and you can
take a look at my github to look at all the projects it took me to get there. 

The easiest way to contact me is through Discord or LinkedIn, but my email is open for inquiries as well.
